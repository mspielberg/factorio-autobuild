[mod-setting-description]
autobuild-cycle-length-in-ticks=How many ticks is one building cycle. Increases amount of overall building actions. Might tank performance, if too low
autobuild-actions-per-cycle=How many building actions are performed in one cycle. Increases amount of overall building actions. Might tank performance, if too high
autobuild-move-latency=Amount of cycles the character needs to stand still, until building candidates are rechecked. Lower values are nice for instant building near the player location, while moving. Might tank performance, if too low
autobuild-move-threshold=How many tiles the user has to move, that it triggers a recheck. Makes building more responsive to player position. Might tank performance, if too low
autobuild-idle-cycles-before-recheck=Amount of cycles after an idle building pause, until building candidates are rechecked. Note: Moving the character like 2 tiles always triggers a recheck. Might tank idling performance, if too low
autobuild-visual-area-opacity=Visual area opacity. 0 is invisible (off)
autobuild-log-level=Debug Log level (0 is nothing, 5 is all)
